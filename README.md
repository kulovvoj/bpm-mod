# BPM Mod

Simple forge mod that tracks and displays crop farming speed via destroyed blocks per second (BPS).

To turn the mod on after loading into Minecraft, use the command **/bpm enable**.

The tracker will start tracking when you first hit a crop. Afterward, it keeps track of elapsed time and number of crops broken and displays both BPS and time elapsed on the screen. The displayed values refresh everytime you hit a crop.
